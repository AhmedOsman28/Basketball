BasketBall Game by Ahmed Osman, Grade 11, Computer Science: ICS3U. 
Completed on January 11th 2024.
It has 2000 lines of code including comments, and uses 39 Functions, 1 Object, 3
Array of Objects and more.

Summary:
Lines 8 - 81.

Starting Screen:
The starting Screen has the title of the game, a basketball bouncing and two buttons.
One of the buttons starts the game while the other one takes you to the description
screen.

Description Screen:
When you are first taken to the description screen you will see text saying "How To
Play?" and under it there is a button. That button will start the description slides
that will tell the user how to play the game. The first slide tells the user the
objective of the game. The next slide tells the users what the different difficulty
modes are and the third slide tells the user how to play. The user can then click the
"Go Back" button on the bottom left corner of the screen to go back to the starting
screen.
                                 Description:
                            *On the description slides*
Objective of the game:
First choose a Streak Goal, TO WIN shoot the ball into the net and get a streak that
is equal to your streak goal. There will be a moving wall that will temporarily block
the net. Shoot the ball at the right time because if the ball hits the wall your
streak will be reset.

Difficulty Modes:
Easy Mode has a Streak Goal of 3
Medium Mode has a Streak Goal of 5
Hard Mode has a Streak Goal of 7

How To Play
Click the UP key to dribble the ball. 
Click the DOWN key to stop dribbling the ball.
Click the shoot button on the bottom left corner to shoot the ball
And click the reset button on the bottom right corner after youâ€™ve gotten the ball
into the net or if the ball hit the wall.


Difficulty Screen:
Once the user goes back to the starting screen and clicks the "Start Game" button
they will be taken to a screen where they can choose their difficulty setting. On the
screen there are three buttons, one is labeled "Easy" the other is labeled "Normal"
and the final one is labeled "Hard". If they click the easy button they will be taken
to the game and will be playing on easy mode with a streak goal of 3, they will only
have to get the ball into the net 3 times in a row without hitting the moving wall.
If they click the normal button the streak goal will be 5 and if they hit the hard
button the streak goal will be 7.

Game Screen:
Once the user chooses their difficulty they will be taken to the game screen. On the
screen there will be a basketball court with a net and lamppost. On the court there
is a player with a basketball and above the court there will be a moving wall that
will temporarily block the net. Behind the court there is a road with cars driving on
it and behind the road you can see the Toronto skyline. In the sky there will be a
setting sun, once the sun sets the moon comes out, the sky turns dark and the
lamppost turns on. 

To reiterate on the game screen there will be three buttons, the shoot button on the
bottom left corner of the screen, if the user clicks that button the player will
shoot the ball. Below the shoot button there is a "Go Back" button that will return
the user to the starting screen and on the bottom right corner there will be a reset
button, if the user clicks that button the ball will return to the players hand. If 
the user wants the player to dribble the ball they can click the UP key, if the user
wants the player to stop dribbling the ball they can click the DOWN key.

On the top left corner of the screen the user can see the streak goal that they chose
and on the top right screen the user can see their current streak.

If the user achieves their streak goal they will be taken to the ending screen.

Ending Screen:
If the user achieves their streak goal they will be taken to a screen that says "YOU
WIN". There will be a simple animation that makes a large ball in the center of the
screen rapidly become smaller until the user can see the ending screen. On the screen
there will be two buttons. One of them will allow the user to play the game again
while the other will take the user back the the starting screen.
